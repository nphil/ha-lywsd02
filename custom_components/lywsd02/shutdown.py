"""The process-lifetime "Home Assistant is shutting down" latch.

Home Assistant runs its shutdown jobs (``hass.async_add_shutdown_job``) before it fires
``EVENT_HOMEASSISTANT_STOP``, and ``hass.state`` is still ``running`` while they run, so
``hass.is_stopping`` cannot be used to tell. Once the latch is set it is never cleared: nothing
in this integration connects to the clock again in this process.
